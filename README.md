# BoggleDevice
Boggle Solver!

This kind of program has been done before, however, I wanted to do something
cool with programming for the first time, and I think this would be a great way
to start, implementing some of the algorithms I have learned in CSE 340 to do
something real.

From what I believe I am doing, I am going to be using a sort of Breadth-First 
Search.

This is part of a 3-phase project that I am going to be working on, developing
not only the code to solve the words, but also the ability to solve the puzzle
in the real world. This is going to be done using an iPhone 7 and a custom
designed 3D-printed rig to move the phone in the xy plane, and having a z-axis
that is a stylus for touch screens. This will act like a finger and be able to
drag a path around the tiles to ultimately create the words.

Phase 1: Implement the program to solve this game
Phase 2: Design and 3D-print all pieces necessary to build this boggle solving
            game
Phase 3: Augment the entire process so that the game can figure the whole thing
            out by itself using computer visision libraries like TensorFlow.
